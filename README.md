## Overview

Data And Time is a simple Android app built with Kotlin that displays the current date and time and updates every 1 second. This app was developed independently by me as part of my internship at InternSavy. It utilizes ViewBinding, `ssp` and `sdp` for XML layout design, and `SimpleDateFormat` for formatting date and time.

## Features

- **Real-time Clock:** Displays the current date and time, updating every 1 second.
- **XML Layout Design:** Utilizes `ssp` and `sdp` for responsive XML layout design.
- **Date Formatting:** Uses `SimpleDateFormat` to format and present date and time in a user-friendly way.
